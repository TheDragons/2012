2012
====

This is the non competition used python code for 2012 i have been expermenting with.

This runs with an experimental threaded loop that calculates rate given from a pot.
It needs to run at a faster than 0.018 per loop speed

UDP port listener, it works but should be worked on to run a bit smoother.
